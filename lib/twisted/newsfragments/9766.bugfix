twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor now raises an exception if instantiated with an event loop which is not compatible with asyncio.SelectorEventLoop. This fixes the AsyncioSelectorReactor in Python 3.8+ on Windows, where in bp-34687 the default Windows asyncio event loop was changed to ProactorEventLoop.  Applications that use AsyncioSelectorReactor on Windows with Python 3.8+ must call asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) before instantiating and running AsyncioSelectorReactor.
